Hospitals sometimes run out of medicines, while others have extra—but there’s no easy way to share them quickly. MediChain fixes that. It’s a simple but powerful application that lets hospitals see each other’s medicine supplies and request what they need in real time.

With MediChain, hospitals can:

- Track their medicine stock in a dashboard.
- Scan medicine labels with AI—no manual typing needed.
- See nearby hospitals on a map and check what medicines they have.
- Request medicines with one click and pay securely.

We made it lightweight and easy to use, especially for smaller hospitals with limited tech or budgets. No complicated setups—just a fast way to prevent shortages.

Note: Right now, we don’t handle deliveries—just the coordination. But in the future, we could add logistics partners.
